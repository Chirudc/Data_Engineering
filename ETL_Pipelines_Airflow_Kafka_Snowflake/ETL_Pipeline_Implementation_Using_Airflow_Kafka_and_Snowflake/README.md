# ETL_Pipeline_Implementation_Using_Airflow_Kafka_and_Snowflake
This project focuses on building and automating ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipelines using Apache Airflow, Kafka, and Snowflake to handle different data sources and workflows. The project consists of three main tasks: orchestrating data ingestion into Snowflake using Airflow, designing an ETL pipeline for a health dataset, and implementing real-time data streaming from Kafka to Snowflake. Each step involves data extraction, transformation, and loading into a structured database schema to ensure data integrity, efficiency, and scalability.

In the first task, Airflow is used to automate the ingestion of a web server access log file into Snowflake. This involves setting up an Airflow DAG, defining the data extraction process, transforming the delimiter format, and ensuring the data is loaded correctly into a Snowflake table. The pipeline execution and results were monitored using the Airflow web interface and Snowflake UI, confirming that the log data was successfully processed and stored.

For the second task, a GitHub-hosted diabetes dataset was processed using an Airflow ETL pipeline. The data was extracted in CSV format, transformed by filtering records with glucose levels above 120, and loaded into a Snowflake table named “DIABETES”. The Airflow pipeline was configured to automate each step, ensuring smooth data processing. Verification was done through Airflow UI and Snowflake queries, proving the successful execution of the ETL pipeline.

The final task involved real-time facebook data streaming using Apache Kafka. A Kafka producer streamed data, which was then consumed and loaded into a Snowflake table. The team set up Kafka brokers, a Zookeeper instance, and a Snowflake consumer script to handle data ingestion. The successful execution was validated using Kafka logs and Snowflake UI. This project demonstrates the efficient integration of Airflow, Kafka, and Snowflake for scalable ETL operations, ensuring data availability, consistency, and automation in a structured environment.
